# JS-Test-2

Complete the function getDropdown such that it returns the  HTML that will fill the existing <select></select> element. 

It should start with: <option value="">Please select</option>
Then, for every country you should have the <option> for that. For example, for the country "Netherlands", you should have the following <option value="netherlands">Netherlands</option>
Notice how the value contains the country name in lower case. The remaining countries will need to show up as well following the same criteria.
